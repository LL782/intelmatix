# Intelmatix Full Stack Developer Coding Assessment

## Overview

To complete this assessment, you will need to write a simple [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) web app and back-end REST APIs (any language), and provide us with the source files to be built.

The purpose of this assessment is to assess your **skills and approach to composing a simple web app and the back-end REST APIs**.

This assessment is expected to take up to **24** hours (3 days).

## What to do?

Your goal is to implement a simple React application, where users will be able to see the stock details of one of the product items.

We will be looking for simple, well-designed, well-commented and how you implement rendering the chart in the submission.

You can use whatever libraries, frameworks, task runners and build processes you like. React and TypeScript are the only requirements for the web app.

You should also create the back-end REST APIs to return the dummy dataset in order to render the page.

## Requirements

Please find the screenshot of the design.

1. Display the item icon
2. Display the item name
3. Displays the current stock and the maximum stock
4. Display a list of all the items in a dropdown list
5. Display a bar chart with a trend line

- 5a. Each bar represents the current stock. i.e. from the first bar, the current stock is 52 KG
- 5b. The trend line represents the number of the demand. i.e. from the first bar, the demand is 20 KG

6. Display 3 colours for the bar to differentiate past, today and future. Also,

- 6a For the past, the trend line should be solid
- 6b For today and the future, the trend line should be dotted

7. Display the indication of today

## Once you complete the implementation

Please submit your code as a ZIP file to [rocky.c@intelmatix.ai](mailto:rocky.c@intelmatix.ai).
